## Validation plugin for Gabriela framework.

*This project as well as [Gabriela framework](https://github.com/gabriela-framework/gabriela) are still under development and in alpha
 stage. Please, do not use it in production until it get to Beta.
 
 This plugin uses [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) under the hood from [hapi.js framework](https://github.com/hapijs) but it 
 abstract and makes a lot easier to use within Gabriela.*
