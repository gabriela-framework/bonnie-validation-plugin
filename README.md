## Validation plugin for Gabriela framework.

*This project as well as [Gabriela framework](https://github.com/gabriela-framework/gabriela) is still in Beta stage so use
it with caution. This plugin uses [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) under the hood from [hapi.js framework](https://github.com/hapijs) but it 
abstracts and makes it a lot easier to use within Gabriela.*

Why the name Bonnie? Its the name of my first dog. Craziest dog you can find
but I loved her.

Refer to [documentation](https://gabriela-framework.github.io/bonnie-validation-plugin/#/) for additional information.
