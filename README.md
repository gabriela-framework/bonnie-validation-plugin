## Validation plugin for Gabriela framework.

*This project as well as [Gabriela framework](https://github.com/gabriela-framework/gabriela) are still under development and in Alpha
stage. Please, do not use it in production until it gets to Beta.
This plugin uses [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) under the hood from [hapi.js framework](https://github.com/hapijs) but it 
abstract and makes a lot easier to use within Gabriela.*

Why the name Bonnie? Its the name of my first dog. Craziest dog you can find
but I loved her.
